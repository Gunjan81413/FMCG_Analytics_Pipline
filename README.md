# FMCG_Analytics_Pipline
# 🏭 Unified Analytics Pipeline — Atlikon × Sports Bar
### End-to-End Data Engineering Project on Databricks (FMCG Domain)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project delivers a **production-grade, end-to-end data engineering pipeline** on **Databricks (Free Edition)** to unify the data infrastructure of **Atlikon** (parent company, sports equipment manufacturer) and its newly acquired subsidiary **Sports Bar** (energy bar startup FMCG). 

The pipeline ingests raw, fragmented data from an **AWS S3 data lake**, processes it through a **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold), and surfaces unified, BI-ready analytics via **Databricks Dashboards** and the **Genie AI assistant** — enabling leadership to make cross-entity decisions without waiting for a multi-year migration.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Domain** | FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) |
| **Companies** | Atlikon (Parent) + Sports Bar (Subsidiary) |
| **Goal** | Unified, reliable analytics dashboard across merged entities |
| **Platform** | Databricks Community / Free Edition |
| **Storage** | AWS S3 (Data Lake) |
| **Pipeline Pattern** | Medallion Architecture (Bronze / Silver / Gold) |

## ❗ Problem Statement

Atlikon, a leading sports equipment manufacturer, recently acquired **Sports Bar**, a fast-growing energy bar startup. While Atlikon operates mature ERP systems with structured data pipelines, Sports Bar's data is highly fragmented:

- 📊 Spreadsheets scattered across team drives
- 💬 WhatsApp conversation exports
- ☁️ Inconsistent cloud storage
- 🔌 Unstandardised APIs with no schema enforcement

This **"data chaos"** created a critical bottleneck:

Leadership could not unify supply chain forecasting or inventory planning because data formats were mismatched, reporting cycles were misaligned, and metrics were inconsistent across both companies.

**The requirement:** A **reliable, scalable, low-learning-curve** solution to provide streamlined cross-company insights — without waiting for a multi-year ERP migration project.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![alt text](resources/FMCG_Architecture.png)

### Layer Descriptions

#### 🥉 Bronze Layer — Raw Data Ingestion
- Reads raw CSV files from the AWS S3 landing zone
- Adds ingestion metadata: `ingestion_timestamp`, `source_file_name`, `source_system`
- No transformations applied; data preserved in original form
- Supports full historical backfill and daily incremental loads

#### 🥈 Silver Layer — Data Cleaning & Transformation
- **Deduplication:** Removes duplicate records using `ROW_NUMBER()` window functions
- **Null Handling:** Imputes or flags missing values based on business rules
- **String Normalization:** Regex-based fixes for city names, product names, and category typos
- **Date Standardization:** Converts all date formats to `YYYY-MM-DD` ISO standard
- **Currency & Unit Conversion:** Normalises values to INR and standard units (kg, litre)
- **SHA-256 Surrogate Keys:** Generates deterministic keys for dimensional entities

#### 🥇 Gold Layer — BI-Ready Aggregated Data
- **Star Schema:** Fact table (`fact_orders`) + dimension tables (`dim_customers`, `dim_products`, `dim_date`, `dim_gross_price`)
- **SCD Type-1 Upserts:** Merge/upsert logic using Databricks `MERGE INTO` for slowly changing dimensions
- **Cross-entity Join:** Sports Bar data merged into Atlikon's Gold layer tables
- **Pre-aggregated KPIs:** Revenue by product, sales by quarter, channel performance

│   ├── dim_date_table_creation.ipynb
│   └── utilities.ipynb
│
├── 2_dimension_data_processing/
│   ├── 1_customers_data_processing.ipynb
│   ├── 2_products_data_processing.ipynb
│   └── 3_pricing_data_processing.ipynb
│
└── 3_fact_data_processing/
    ├── 1_full_load_fact.ipynb
    └── 2_incremental_load_fact.ipynb
```

### Execution Flow
